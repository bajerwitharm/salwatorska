\begin{abstract}
The goal of this publication is to describe lightweight, cost effective approach
for creating access and monitoring system to WiFi network in small and medium
size buildings.
The basic assumption is that the system should support per user
authentication and network usage statistics.
In contrast to current market available solutions the presented one requires
very little modification of off-the-self low cost routers to enable wide range
of new functionalities. The core or the system is based on OpenWRT Linux running
on multiple WiFi access points spread throughout the building.
For data storage and visualization centralized solution 
based on Node.js server and AngularJS frontend running on RaspberryPi
development board is used.

\section{Introduction}
%

It is expected that the WiFi market will continue to grow tremendously over the
next few years. One of main driving factors for this is the increasing number of
smart devices (mobiles phones, tablets, smartwatches and smart TVs\ldots). The
observed pattern is to maximum data usage by the end users when they are
stationary connected to WiFi in homes, restaurants and offices.
Additionaly, eventhough the falling prices of mobile transfer, it is common that
smart devices are configured to trigger data intensive applications such as
updates and synchronization only while being connected to WiFi.

Small businesses are often in a difficult position when it comes to network
security. On one hand the growing demand for WiFi access is pusshing them
towards allowing more users to access their WiFi network, on the other hand they
lack the cheap and secure solution for doing so. The main requiremnt for them is
to enable secure per user access and monitoring. 

Further in this paper, the approach for praparation of internal WiFi network in
medium size rent house is presented. The goal of the project is not only to
provide WiFi netowrk to the users, but also to setup backbone for planned
smart home installation.

\section{Network access control}
For many years the focus in netowork security was placed on protecting
network from external threats using firewalls. Nowadays, attention has turned
towards protecting crucial network resources against the ''enemy within''. To
defend the network against internal threats user authenitification and
access control is necessery even for small networks. 

Separate topic is WiFi piggybacking. Apart from security issue,
unauthorized access to network can result in steeling bandwith. What is far
worse, piggybacking can be used as a means of hiding illegal activities
(pornography, torrenting..etc) impersonating netowrk owner.

An Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA) \cite{rfc2903}\cite{rfc2904}
concept was designed to autheniticate and authorize users for use of network
resources. Authentication part confirms that a user who is requesting a service
is a valid user. Authorization grants specific types of service to a user, based
on their authentication. Accounting refers to the tracking of the consumption of
network resources by users.

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) \cite{rfc2865} is one of
most widely used protocols to provide AAA. For the network presented in this
publication FreeRadius \cite{freeRadius} has been used. To reduce load on
router, the server is running on one of the WiFi access points. Router and other
APs are considered as clients for FreeRadius server.

The assumption for network to be prepared was to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fast and reliable WiFi throughout whole building,
  \item Cost-oriented implementation,
  \item Separate isolated virtual subnetwork for critical devices
such as surveillance cameras, smart home automation devices or network attached
storage,
  \item Easy to manage, per user, internet access for devices guest devices via
  dedicated subnetwork,
  \item Web page for network administration accessible both internally and
  externally,
  \item External access to internal network via VPN tunnel.
\end{enumerate}
