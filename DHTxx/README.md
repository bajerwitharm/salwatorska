# DHT11/DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor reading with OpenWRT based router
## Abstract
The goal of this document is to describe implementation of reading [DHTxx](http://www.micropik.com/PDF/dht11.pdf) temperature/humidity sensor by [TP-Link TL-WDR4300](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300) router running OpenWRT. 

This application is a part of larger home-automation project: https://github.com/bajerwitharm/smartbuilding

Important info:

* To compile software it is required to have toolchain for the [Atheros AR9344](http://cykey.ca/~cykey/airport/AR9344.pdf) (OpenWRT prefered). 
* The compiled application for TP-Link WDR-4300 (OpenWrt 15.05 Linux Kernel 3.18.14) is also available on github
* Software is not a driver, all calculations are performed in user space. Unfortunetely, this is not very optimal solution since waiting for DATA change pin are done as ***while*** loop. To increase accuracy process priority is increased to highest during the time critical part.

## DHTxx communication protocol
[DHT11](http://www.micropik.com/PDF/dht11.pdf) is a 4 pin sensor which can measure temperatures ranging from 0~50째C with accuracy of 1째C & relative humidity ranging from 20-95%. [DHT22](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf) has better characteristics - humidity 0~100%RH; temperature -40~80째C with accuracy of 0.5째C. The sensor uses its own proprietary 1-wire protocol to communicate with master device. 

## Sensor connection
The only PIN which is not used by the [TL-WDR4300](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300) router is located at pin 5 of [JTAG (JP1)](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#gpio) slot. This pin is connected to GPIO 2. The sensor can be connected directly without pull-up resistor. Other pins can be used if special purpose of GPIO will be disabled (see initialization of GPIO). 3,3V power supply can be taken from [Serial port](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#serial_console) slot. 

## Customization to other routers
Generally this software should work without problems on other routers. It is required to customize GPIO registers addresses to support used uP.

## Usage
**./dht11** ***pin*** ***sensor_type***

Description: ***pin*** is the router's GPIO pin number to which DATA pin of DHTxx sensor is connected, ***sensor_type*** is ***xx*** in DHT***xx***

i.e.

**./dht11** ***2*** ***11***

output is [JSON](http://json.org/) coded string containing temperature in Celsius and humidity in [%RH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity):

```json
{
temp: 28.000000,
humidity: 31.000000
}
```

In addition if [luci](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials) is installed and [gettemp](https://github.com/bajerwitharm/smartbuilding/blob/master/DHTxx/gettemp) file is copied to ***/www/cgi-bin*** script results can be accessed via web browser at address ***http://router-ip/cgi-bin/gettemp***

## MQTT extension

Temperature and humidity can be served to smart home automation using [MQTT](mqtt.org) protocol. To perform connection [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) is suggested.

Remote version:

```Shell
!/bin/bash
mqtt_server='192.168.0.25'
data_url='http://192.168.0.29/cgi-bin/gettemp'
data=$(curl "$data_url")
temp=$(echo "$data" | grep -Po '(?<=temp: )[^,]*')
humidity=$(echo "$data" | grep -Po '(?<=humidity: )[^,]*')
echo $temp
echo $humidity
mosquitto_pub -h "$mqtt_server" -t "nullo/temp" -m "$temp"
mosquitto_pub -h "$mqtt_server" -t "nullo/humidity" -m "$humidity"
```

```Shell
!/bin/ash
mqtt_server='test.mosquitto.org'
data=$(/root/dht11 2 11)
temp=$(echo "$data" | grep -Eo "(temp: )[^,]*" | sed "s/^temp: //")
humidity=$(echo "$data" | grep -Eo "(humidity: )[^,]*" | sed "s/^humidity: //")
echo $temp
echo $humidity
mosquitto_pub -h "$mqtt_server" -t "click_senzations/temp1" -m "$temp"
mosquitto_pub -h "$mqtt_server" -t "click_senzations/humidity1" -m "$humidity"
```
